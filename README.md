# DefCon-Talk

I watched, more so listented since it was not video of the actual talk, the DefCon Talk on Anonymous Cyber War.
It was a shitshow and problematic. It started out as an informational. I learned about how Anonymous was started,
their role in a  successful Scientology protest, and how at first they were not so much "hackervists" as the media made
them out to be. Halfway through the talk it took a sharp turn when audience members began to chime in. One speaker, which I am assuming is a man, made a rape joke when Aarron Bar's name came into the converstaion. He also told a heated audience member they were a "faggot". The woman speaker, which I am assuming is a woman, used the word "retarded".
