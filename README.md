# DefCon-Talk

I watched, more so listented since it was not video of the actual talk, the DefCon Talk on Anonymous Cyber War.
It was a shitshow and problematic. It started out as a informational. I learned about how Anonymous was started,
their role in a  successful Scientology protest, and how at first they were not so much "hackervists" as the media made
them out to be. Soon after the talk went south. The man speaker, which I am assuming is a man, made a rape joke. Apparently Anonymous is a heated subject as halfway through the talk it took a sharp turn when audience members began to chime in. There was inaudible chat from an audience member and the male moderator told them they were a "faggot". Lots of back and fourh between the two moderators and audience members about exposing private information resulting in tantrums by both parties. The woman speaker, which I am assuming is a woman, used the word "retarded". This talk is a real life version of trolls on a message board. I should have watched the video Tarah recommended instead.
